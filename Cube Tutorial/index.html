            <p style="color: white;"> <b>Before we get into the notations:</b> <br>
To understand the rubik's cube notations you must first know these 2 words: <br>
                <br>
<b>clockwise; counterclockwise</b><br>
                <br>
When you turn a side clockwise, you turn it according to how it looks when you are facing it.<br>
<i>For example: If you want to turn the back side clockwise but you are facing the front, you will have to turn it counterclockwise as thats
how you would turn it clockwise if you were facing it.<br>
                </i>
Also, when a notation has an apostrophe behind it, it becomes counterclockwise (R, 'R). <br>
If it's a lowercase letter instead of a capital letter, you have to move the middle row in which axis the original
move was, with the original move. <br>
                <br>
<b>Notations:</b><br>
U for Up <br>
D for Down <br>
L for Left <br>
R for Right <br>
F for Front <br>
B for Back <br>
x for rotating the cube like an R <br>
y for rotating the cube like a U <br>
z for rotating the cube like an F <br>
M for the layer between L and R <br>
E for the layer between U and D <br>
S for the layer between F and B<br>
                <br>
<b>Algorithms:</b><br>
An algorithm is a set of notations telling you the way to move the cube.<br>
<i>Example: RU'R'U. You have to do these notations in that order.</i><br>
